# DATA 180

This repository is made for the class DATA 180 and contains the necessary material required to complete the GitHub project. The only requirement for this repository is a README.md file with proper format, but I have also uploaded a random MATLAB file to test out uploading files and to write about in the following sections.

## Getting Started

The only requirement to run the MATLAB code BeadAnalysis.m is to have MATLAB installed so that the code can be run.

### Prerequisites

The prerequisite to install MATLAB is to have a functioning version of MATLAB. This requires you to have a valid license MATLAB. The license can be obtained in the following ways:

```
Buy the license on the MathWorks website
Access a free license that may be provided to you by your employer, school, etc.
```

### Summary of Code

This MATLAB code is for a lab assignment from PHYS 332W in which the intensity of bead like objects are analyzed to find the properties of the Fabry–Pérot interferometer and the wavelength of the HeNe laser and Halogen lamp that would be shining through it. The source picture of the beads and the calculations finding the intensity of the beads are not included, but the intensity of the beads is included so it can be used in the code.
